An advanced AI-powered application designed to assist with Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) concepts, implementations, and document analysis. The system utilizes multiple specialized agents to provide comprehensive support for OOAD-related tasks.

## Features

### 1. Specialized Agents ü§ñ

- **Concept Clarification Agent**: Explains OOAD concepts, principles, and theoretical questions
- **Code Snippet Generator Agent**: Generates example code, implementation patterns, and coding solutions
- **Design Assistant Agent**: Provides system design guidance, UML diagrams, and architectural recommendations
- **Document Analyzer Agent**: Processes and analyzes uploaded documents with OOAD-specific insights

### 2. Document Management üìÑ

- Supports multiple file formats:
  - Text files (.txt)
  - PDF documents (.pdf)
  - Word documents (.docx)
  - Images (.jpg, .jpeg, .png)
- Automatic document analysis and content extraction
- Persistent storage of documents and analyses
- Document version tracking and management

### 3. Query Management üí¨

- Intelligent query routing to appropriate specialized agents
- Context-aware responses based on uploaded documents
- History tracking of queries and responses
- Quick access to recent queries and their results

### 4. Interactive Interface üñ•Ô∏è

- Clean, user-friendly Streamlit interface
- Real-time response generation
- Document upload and management capabilities
- Comprehensive query history with deletion functionality

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Python 3.x
- **Database**: SQLite
- **AI Integration**: Google's Generative AI (Gemini)
- **Document Processing**: 
  - PyPDF2 for PDF processing
  - python-docx for Word documents
  - Pillow for image processing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vakes/OOAD_Agent.git
   cd OOAD_Agent
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
